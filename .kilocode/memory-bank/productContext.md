# Product Context: Hermes Resort Task Management System

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Resort operations face significant challenges in task management that impact guest satisfaction and operational efficiency:

1. **Communication Gaps**: Front desk staff cannot efficiently track housekeeping and maintenance task status, leading to delays in guest room readiness
2. **Accountability Issues**: Manual time tracking allows for inaccuracies and makes performance evaluation difficult
3. **Quality Control**: No standardized system for verifying task completion quality or documenting issues
4. **Mobile Workforce**: Housekeeping and maintenance staff work primarily on mobile devices but lack dedicated tools
5. **Shift Complexity**: Managing dual shifts and worker rotations creates scheduling conflicts and coverage gaps

### Solution Approach
Hermes provides a centralized, role-based task management system that addresses these core operational challenges through:

- **Real-time Task Tracking**: Live status updates across all departments
- **Photo Verification**: Categorized photo documentation for quality assurance
- **Dual Timestamp System**: Client and server timestamps prevent time tampering
- **Mobile-First Design**: PWA capabilities for field workers with offline support
- **Shift Management**: Comprehensive scheduling with dual-shift support and rotation patterns

### Core Workflows

1. **Task Creation**: Front office staff create tasks with specific requirements, photo documentation needs, and priority levels
2. **Task Assignment**: Tasks automatically assigned to available workers based on department, shift, and skill set
3. **Task Execution**: Workers receive tasks, start timers, document progress with photos, and track time
4. **Quality Verification**: Supervisors review completed tasks, verify photo documentation, and provide quality ratings
5. **Audit Trail**: All state changes logged with dual timestamps for compliance and accountability

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Goals
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Role-based interfaces optimized for specific user needs
- **Rapid Task Adoption**: < 30 seconds from login to first task interaction
- **Seamless Mobile Experience**: Full functionality on mobile devices with offline capability
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Status indicators, progress bars, and photo previews
- **Minimal Training**: New users productive within 15 minutes of first use

### Success Metrics
- **Task Completion Rate**: > 95% of tasks completed within estimated time
- **Photo Documentation**: > 90% of required photos captured and categorized
- **User Engagement**: > 80% of workers actively using timer features
- **Quality Verification**: < 24 hours average time from completion to verification
- **Mobile Usage**: > 70% of interactions from mobile devices

### Pain Points Addressed
- **No More Paper**: Eliminates paper-based task sheets and checklists
- **Real-time Visibility**: Front desk can see actual task status vs. estimated completion
- **Accountability**: Dual timestamps prevent time manipulation and ensure accurate tracking
- **Quality Control**: Photo verification and rating system ensures consistent standards
- **Shift Coverage**: Automated scheduling prevents gaps and ensures adequate coverage
