- Real-time task assignment and tracking with dual timestamp validation
- Photo documentation system with categorized requirements
- Shift scheduling with dual-shift support
- Quality assurance workflow with ratings and verification
- Mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) design
- Offline capabilities for field workers
- Comprehensive audit logging for compliance

## Primary Goals
1. **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce task completion time by 30% through streamlined workflows
2. **Quality Assurance**: Implement photo verification and rating system for task completion
3. **Accountability**: Dual timestamp system prevents time tampering and ensures accurate tracking
4. **Mobile Accessibility**: PWA design enables workers to use personal devices efficiently
5. **Scalability**: Support for multiple resort locations and departments

## Success Metrics
- Task completion rate > 95%
- Average task completion time < estimated duration + 15%
- User adoption rate > 80% across all roles
- System uptime > 99.5%
- Mobile usage > 70% of total interactions

## Scope Boundaries
- Single resort deployment with potential multi-location expansion
- Integration with existing resort property management systems
